    "- The given problem is related with time wasted in granting and revoking access to the employee within company.  For employee to access any resources he/she needs prior permission i.e. access of that resource. The access granting and revoking process is manual, handled by superviso. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a nontrivial amount of time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Objective:</b> We have to build a model, learned using historical data, that will determine an employee's access needs, such that manual access transactions (grants and revokes) are minimized as the employee's attributes change over time. The model will take an employee's role information and a resource code and will return whether or not access should be granted.\n",

    "- <b>Data:</b> The data consists of real historical data collected from 2010 & 2011. Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources over time. You must create an algorithm capable of learning from this historical data to predict approval/denial for an unseen set of employees.\n",

    "Our training data contains categorical data (information that is divided into groups, it could be numbers but without mathematical meaning like IDs). Thus, we should encode it or use algorithms that can deal with categorical data like CatBoost. If we don't preprocess this categorical data, some algorithms may learn false information. For example, an ID of 1000 would be considered as much greater than an ID of 1 which is not necessarily true. Thus we can use OneHotEncoder to before using algorithms on categorical data. One-hot encoding in machine learning is the conversion of categorical information into a format that may be fed into machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy. It is a common method for dealing with categorical data in machine learning. Categorical variables must be changed in the pre-processing section since machine learning models require numeric input variables. Nominal or ordinal data can be found in categorical data. This approach creates a new column for each unique value in the original category column. The zeros and ones are subsequently put in these dummy variables (1 meaning TRUE, 0 meaning FALSE)"

It is very applicable in situations when a data scientist or machine learning engineer is confused about which classification method to use. Therefore, using the predictions from multiple classifiers, the voting classifier makes predictions based on the most frequent one. It simply aggregates the findings of each classifier passed into Voting Classifier and predicts the output class based on the highest majority of voting. The idea is instead of creating separate dedicated models and finding the accuracy for each them, we create a single model which trains by these models and predicts output based on their combined majority of voting for each output class."
